My vim config mixed with kickstart and refactored.

Mainly targets:

- C / C++
- CSS/HTML
- Javascript
- Lua
- Python
- Rust
- Shell / Bash
- TOML
- Markdown...

Includes easily customizable menus (try `gm` in NORMAL mode).

"High level" settings are available in [lua/config/settings.lua](https://github.com/fdev31/kickstart.nvim/blob/master/lua/config/settings.lua)

By default leader is `~` (feel free to use space...), but many shortcuts are starting with `g`.

Other notables shortcuts:

- `Ctrl+Enter` for fuzzy searching the current buffer
- `Ctrl+P` for a curated symbol navigator modal
- `@s` to select the lastly "pasted" content
